# xgb-tree-playground
Playground with dummy data for simulating wastewater compliance risk
# Wastewater XGBoost Tree Playground

Interactive Streamlit app that demonstrates how XGBoost learns
tree-by-tree on wastewater-style data (WIMS / SCADA inspired).

## Run locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
# Commit message:
5. Commit

## STEP 5 — Sanity check
Your repo should now contain:
- `app.py`
- `requirements.txt`
- `README.md`

You’re done. 🎉

## Next optional upgrades (all web-based)
If you want, we can:
- Deploy this to **Streamlit Community Cloud** (one-click from GitHub)
- Add screenshots or a GIF of the animation
- Add a “CEO mode” tab that simplifies language
- Add badges (Python version, Streamlit)

Just tell me what’s next.
